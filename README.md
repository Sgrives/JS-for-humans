# JS for humans üë®‚Äçüíª

I created this repo for education propeses and you all are welcome to contribute and add useful information about JS - so we all could become better devs! 

For now this repo contains only few sections but Im planning to add new ones every week. 

If you noticed I did some mistakes or explained something incorrectly - please make a PR so everyone can enjoy accurate information! :smile: 

## sources 
A lot of the information is summary of the AMAZING books by [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify) So for more information please visit his GH page.
